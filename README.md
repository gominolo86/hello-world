Hi, my name is Thomas Moses and I am a 39 year old resident of Olive Branch, MS. What to tell you about myself...well, I am a simple, down to earth type of guy. I retired from DJing in the Memphis club scene several years ago. I work as a Systems Administrator for Buckman Laboratories headquartered in Memphis. Most days, I enjoy my job, but I guess each job will have its moments. I do not get to do much in my off hours, but I really enjoy photography and anything to do with Space. I am single with no kids, although I pray that God will bless me in this area of my life. I have a lab named Rocky and a terror mix named Spanky. I am a member of Life Fellowship Church in Olive Branch and serve often on our Tech team which is responsible for the production aspect of our services. I tell you, it is such a rewarding experience to get plugged into the ministry. Having the opportunity to be involved in many peoples journey with Christ makes it a true blessing. You should come join us on a Sunday to see what it is all about. Well enough about me. If you want to know anything else about me, please drop me a line.
